        <h1>Continuous Developer Training</h1>
        <p>
            This repository/website tries to create a space for continuous training
            that you can utilise whenever you feel it is the right time to learn or relearn
            some development skill.
        </p>
        <p>
            It contains example projects with lists of requirements, references to interesting
            books and videos as well as other websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not only is it a collection but it also contains little random selectors. So when 
            you find yourself in a situation where you can train alone or in pair programming
            for a little bit of time you can simply press a button and something will be proposed.
            Maybe a test project, maybe a technology, maybe an article ...
        </p>
