    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <hr>
    <h4>Chapter 1: Introduction</h4>

    <p>The author wants to teach us how to see bottlenecks.</p>

    <hr>

    <h4>Chapter 2: Everyday Bottlenecks</h4>

    <p>
        The author tells a little story of his way to work one day. 
        Along the way he is showing off some bottlenecks: 
        An airport runway, a coffee machine and the internet connection.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 3: It isn't obvious</h4>

    <p>People overlook bottlenecks for various reasons:
        <ul>
            <li>They do not know that bottlenecks exist.</li>
            <li>The bottlenecks are devious bastards, so they ignore them.</li>
            <li>The bottlenecks move around, so they are hard to catch.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 4: Workplace Bottleneck "Sinead"</h4>

    <p>
        The author describes a real life bottleneck in an accounting department and 
        how the problem was identified and removed by just a few questions.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 5: Egg of columbus</h4>

    <p>
        The author tells the story of the egg of columbus making a point that, yes, 
        in hindsight the bottleneck was clear to see and the solution was very clear
        also. But what is at work here has the name "hindsight bias" and is just our mind 
        playing tricks on us. If it was easy to find and handle bottlenecks we would not
        have the discussion.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 6: Workplace Bottleneck "Derek"</h4>

    <p>
        The author describes a real life bottleneck in a retail store where the bottleneck
        has been identified as "the printer" and changing the file format for printing removed 
        the problem. Not buying another printer.
    </p>

    <h4>Chapter 7: Wild and Tamed Bottlenecks</h4>

    <p>
        The author introduces two classes of bottlenecks.

        <ul>
            <li><mark>The wild bottleneck</mark><br>
                The wild bottleneck is most often hidden and not managed or poorly managed.
            </li>
            <li><mark>The tamed bottleneck</mark><br>
                A tamed bottleneck has a capacity that is too low, but it has been discovered and is now visible and managed.
            </li>
            <li><mark>FOCCCUS formula</mark><br>
                The FOCCCUS formula is a rewording of Goldratts 5 steps of focussing and can be used to tame wild bottlenecks.
            </li>
        </ul>
        
    </p>
