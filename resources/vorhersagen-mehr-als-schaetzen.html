    <h2>Summary</h2>

    <p>
      In his book Ralf Westphal takes on a pain that software development organisations all over the planet face: "When will this 
      be ready?". 
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple question is very simple, yet often stirrs up a lot of inter-personal problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ralf Westphal creates a journey for us on which he explains an idea how to organize that in a way that will make all 
      stakeholders happy, including the customers, the product owners and the developers.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Organizational Structure
        <ul>
          <li>The developers are responsible for creating good software.</li>            
          <li>The product owner is responsible for the creation of value in a software development environment. 
            He can speak to the customer and get a picture of the valuable tasks that need to be performed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>For Forecasts:
        <ul>
          <li>The developers are responsible for giving the product owner an impression of solution complexity and the hurdles involved, when asked.<br>
            Deadlines must not be given to the developers as they are not responsible for time.
          </li>
          <li>The product owner is responsible for collecting the statistical data and creating a forecast.<br>
            The product owners job is it to create forecasts and, if necessary, navigate or reduce the amount of remaining work 
            as well as to discuss with the customers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li>At first the author explores some different ideas how to approach the forecast from different angles, finally
        concluding that the Monte Carlo Simulation is the best that can possibly be done. 
      </li>
      <li>He then uses the concept and shows what times need to be gathered to get [need to continue here]</li>
