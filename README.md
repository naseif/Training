# Projects

I want to have a long term relationship with the ideas that I have and implement as software.
By retaining the requirements I get a few positive side effects. 
1) I can use the same projects as training material for fun with other developers.
2) I can reimplement projects using different tech stacks and approaches, thus get more depth.
3) I do not forget anymore what I wanted to achieve.

## A project is to big for today?

If a project is too big for today, you might exercise with these other things:

## Naming convention for repositories

This is not a must, but I recommend it when you find yourself implementing the projects more often and want to retain a certain overview in your github. I certainly use it.

I recommend the following structure for naming your repositories:
 - first the project Id: Pxxx
 - then the project type you are going for: Console, WebApp, WebApi, GUI, Library ...
 - then the operating system you are going for: Win32, Win64, Linux, MacOS, X (x=cross platform)
 - then the name of the programming language or stack you want to use: C, CSharp, JavaScript, Python...
 - optionally followed by a 3 digit number which is the iteration
and all seperated by hyphens
 - optionally, if there are variants listed in the requirements, you might add the variant number Vxxx you are going for

examples: 
- P001-Console-Linux-C
- P001-Console-Linux-C-002
- P001-Console-Linux-C-003-V004
- P001-Console-Linux-CSharp
- P001-GUI-Win64-CSharp-V001

This might make my repositories a little bit less readable, unless you know what you are looking for. Nontheless it is a more structured approch and it really makes sense in the grand scope of things.

## additional ideas to make the training more effective and fun

- Remove your mouse from the computer. Let us see if you are good enough to do the challenge keyboard only.
- Implement the same project multiple times. Measure the time needed. In every iteration try to finish in half the time.

## degrees of maturity for any task / project

- Level 1: We did the task somehow. It works now. 
- Level 2: We did the task in below 1 hour.
- Level 3: All information for doing the task was already available. We did not need to use google or search around anywhere else.
- Level 4: The task was done during regular working hours.
- Level 5: We planned to do this task at this time.
