# Training program

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stho32/training/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stho32/training)

I believe strongly that the only way to be a professional programmer is to train a bit every day, at least a few hours per week. (Robert C. Martin actually sets the time to 3 hours a day. I am not sure if I am able to achieve this but I am willing to try.)

The long term goal of this repository is to create a training program to help people become extraordinary and professional software developers. People that are trained this way should have an awesome knowledge base that they share, which enables them to work together in a company or group of their choice while circumventing the problems that the normal confusion "what it means to be a professional software developer" brings with it.

As I am a coder myself, it helps me to organize my own training as well, which means that I "eat my own dogfood".

I recommend working on the training in a group of at least two, maybe with someone more experienced and one less experienced member. The requirements "business centric", not tech-stack-centric. Technologies change. requirements stay.

## Get Started

There are some things you should know at least to get started.  

- [Using git and github](GetStarted/git-and-github.md) Without an understanding of git and github you cannot share your work efficiently.
- [Naming convention](GetStarted/Naming-convention.md) Understanding and using the naming convention will help you organize your github-Repositories in a way that you get less confused, when, e.g. you have finally collected 10 different approaches to implement a certain project... 
- [Reading List](GetStarted/Reading-List.md) A collection of books with short summaries of what help you can expect from it depending on your situation.

## Environment / Base Projects

Working in a more professional context means, that there are some things you need to share in your group.

- [BP001](BaseProjects/BP001/README.md) - create a project template for your projects ([implementations](BaseProjects/BP001/KnownImplementations.md))
- [BP002](BaseProjects/BP002/README.md) - create an environment-application for your coding endeavours ([implementations](BaseProjects/BP002/KnownImplementations.md))

## Meta/Tool Projects

Here is a bunch of meta projects that you should have available in a group, so when you are coding for the same company all applications have a common ground.

- [M001](ToolProjects/M001/README.md) - A code generator that reads a database table structure and generates code (in a window) for copy and paste ([implementations](ToolProjects/M001/KnownImplementations.md))
- M002 - A SQL Code Formatter
- M003 - A core library that helps you in a bunch of projects
- M004 - A style guide that builds the html,css and javascript you need and has a good documentation, so that your apps all look and behave alike

## additional ideas to make the training more effective and fun

- Remove your mouse from the computer. Let us see if you are good enough to do the challenge keyboard only.
- Implement the same project multiple times. Measure the time needed. In every iteration try to finish in half the time.

## degrees of maturity for any task / project

- Level 1: We did the task somehow. It works now. 
- Level 2: We did the task in below 1 hour.
- Level 3: All information for doing the task was already available. We did not need to use google or search around anywhere else.
- Level 4: The task was done during regular working hours.
- Level 5: We planned to do this task at this time.
