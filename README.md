# Projects

The long term goal of this repository is to create a training program to help people become extraordinary and professional software developers.
As I am a coder myself, it helps me to organize my own training as well, which means that I "eat my own dogfood".

## Get Started
- [Using git and github](git-and-github.md)
- [Naming convention](Naming-convention.md)
- [Reading List](Reading-List.md)

## Environment / Base Projects
- [BP001](BP001/README.md) - create a project template for your projects ([implementations](BP001/KnownImplementations.md))
- [BP002](BP002/README.md) - create an environment-application for your coding endeavours ([implementations](BP002/KnownImplementations.md))

## Meta/Tool Projects

- [M001](M001/README.md) - A code generator that reads a database table structure and generates code (in a window) for copy and paste
- M002 - A SQL Code Formatter
- M003 - A core library that helps you in a bunch of projects

## additional ideas to make the training more effective and fun

- Remove your mouse from the computer. Let us see if you are good enough to do the challenge keyboard only.
- Implement the same project multiple times. Measure the time needed. In every iteration try to finish in half the time.

## degrees of maturity for any task / project

- Level 1: We did the task somehow. It works now. 
- Level 2: We did the task in below 1 hour.
- Level 3: All information for doing the task was already available. We did not need to use google or search around anywhere else.
- Level 4: The task was done during regular working hours.
- Level 5: We planned to do this task at this time.
