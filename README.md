# Developer Training Program :mortar_board:

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stho32/training/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/stho32/training)

I believe strongly that the only way to be a professional programmer is to train a bit every day, at least a few hours per week. (Robert C. Martin actually sets the time to 3 hours a day. I am not sure if I am able to achieve this but I am willing to try.)

The long term goal of this repository is to create a training program to help people become extraordinary and professional software developers. People that are trained this way should have an awesome knowledge base that they share, which enables them to work together in a company or group of their choice while circumventing the problems that the normal confusion "what it means to be a professional software developer" brings with it.

As I am a coder myself, it helps me to organize my own training as well, which means that I "eat my own dogfood".

I recommend working on the training in a small group of at least two. The requirements are "business centric", not tech-stack-centric. Technologies change. requirements stay. Thus you can again and again revisit the same projects using new tech and try out new approaches.

## The very basics

There are some things you should know at least to get started.  

- [Using git and github](GetStarted/git-and-github.md) Without an understanding of git and github you cannot share your work efficiently.
- [Naming convention](GetStarted/Naming-convention.md) Understanding and using the naming convention will help you organize your github-Repositories in a way that you get less confused, when, e.g. you have finally collected 10 different approaches to implement a certain project... 
- [Authors](GetStarted/Books/index.md) A collection of good authors and their works so you can look for topics of interest and gain deeper understanding.
- [Watching List](GetStarted/Good-Videos.md) A list of videos
- [GitHub Badges that might help](GetStarted/github-badges.md) GitHub has small little badges that help you demonstrate your skill and verify certain things about your repository

## Projects

- [Environment / Base Projects](BaseProjects/README.md)
- [Tool Projects](ToolProjects/README.md)

- [Projects to try yourself out](Projects/README.md)


## additional ideas to make the training more effective and fun

- Remove your mouse from the computer. Let us see if you are good enough to do the challenge keyboard only.
- Implement the same project multiple times. Measure the time needed. In every iteration try to finish in half the time.

## degrees of maturity for any task / project

- Level 1: We did the task somehow. It works now. 
- Level 2: We did the task in below 1 hour.
- Level 3: All information for doing the task was already available. We did not need to use google or search around anywhere else.
- Level 4: The task was done during regular working hours.
- Level 5: We planned to do this task at this time.

## Developer Levels

- Level 1: Tinkering around, mostly using google, copying stuff, maybe did a first tutorial
- Level 2: Did grasp the basic concepts: variables, loops, ...
- Level 3: Has created a first project of his own, that is something he/she can personally use, all by him-/herself.
- Level 4: Grasped classes and inheritance, did code at least 10 projects including classes, some of them are libraries to use with other projects.
- Level 5: Can read and work with other peoples code. 
- Level 6: Has an understanding of the SOLID principles and uses object oriented design.
- Level 7: Uses the principles and unit tests to create understandable code that can be used and maintained by others.
- Level 8: Finds a new technology, methodology or something else and goes back to Level 1.
