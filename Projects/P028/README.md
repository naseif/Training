# "feed"

- [ ] There is a web application.

- [ ] There is a list of food delivery options (e.g. dominos, different restaurants)

- [ ] There is one person that organizes the food for everybody. We call him "host".

- [ ] There are many people that the host wants to supply with food. We call them "feed-me-buddies".

- Process:
  1. [ ] The host creates a new food supply session and gets an individual link.
    1. [ ] The host selects 1-n food suppliers.
    2. [ ] The host adds a list of email-adresses that he wishes to invite.
    3. [ ] The host adds a deadline time after which ordering for the feed-me-buddies is not possible anymore.
    4. [ ] The host can add a title and a description to the session.
  2. [ ] An email is sent to the "feed-me-buddies" containing a buddy link for all feed-me-buddies.
  3. [ ] The "feed-me-buddies" click the link in the mail and are sent to a web site in which they can write down their name and the food wishes as well as the price that they anticipate.
  4. [ ] The "feed-me-buddies" have a button with which they can finalize their order.
  5. [ ] When the order is finalized a message is sent out to the host which contains the order changes so the host is informed.
  6. [ ] When the time limit has been reached the host
    1. [ ] receives an email detailling the complete order
    2. [ ] the individual link of the session still works and also contains the full order
  7. [ ] The session website changes its look for payment management
    1. [ ] Next to each participant there is a field in which the host can enter the amount of payment that he has received from the "feed-me-buddy"
    2. [ ] Differences are shown
    3. [ ] The host has the option to close the session when everything is to his or her liking (all payments received or distributed ...)
