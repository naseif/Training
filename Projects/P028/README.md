# "feed"

- There is a web application.

- There is a list of food delivery options (e.g. dominos, different restaurants)

- There is one person that organizes the food for everybody. We call him "host".

- There are many people that the host wants to supply with food. We call them "feed-me-buddies".

- Process:
  1. The host creates a new food supply session and gets an individual link.
  2. The host selects 1-n food suppliers.
  3. The host adds a list of email-adresses that he wishes to invite.
  4. The host adds a deadline time after which ordering for the feed-me-buddies is not possible anymore.
  5. An email is sent to the "feed-me-buddies" containing a buddy link for all feed-me-buddies.
  6. The "feed-me-buddies" click the link in the mail and are sent to a web site in which they can write down their name and the food wishes as well as the price that they anticipate.
  7. The "feed-me-buddies" have a button with which they can finalize their order.
  8. When the order is finalized a message is sent out to the host which contains the order changes so the host is informed.
  9. When the time limit has been reached the host
    1. receives an email detailling the complete order
    2. the individual link of the session still works and also contains the full order
  10. The session website changes its look for payment management
    1. Next to each participant there is a field in which the host can enter the amount of payment that he has received from the "feed-me-buddy"
    2. Differences are shown
    3. The host has the option to close the session when everything is to his or her liking (all payments received or distributed ...)
  
## Preparation

- The host has the possiblity to preselect a bunch of food suppliers.
