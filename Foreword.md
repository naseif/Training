# Foreword

I believe strongly that the only way to be a professional programmer is to train a bit every day, at least a few hours per week. (Robert C. Martin actually sets the time to 3 hours a day. I am not sure if I am able to achieve this but I am willing to try.)

The long term goal of this repository is to create a training program to help people become extraordinary and professional software developers. People that are trained this way should have an awesome knowledge base that they share, which enables them to work together in a company or group of their choice while circumventing the problems that the normal confusion "what it means to be a professional software developer" brings with it.

As I am a coder myself, it helps me to organize my own training as well, which means that I "eat my own dogfood".

I recommend working on the training in a small group of at least two. The requirements are "business centric", not tech-stack-centric. Technologies change. requirements stay. Thus you can again and again revisit the same projects using new tech and try out new approaches.
